# Pi Pico Relay B to MQTT/HA
Integrate a Raspberry Pi Pico W controlled Waveshare Pico-Relay-B into Home Assistant

You will need the folder umqtt and its contents from here:
https://github.com/micropython/micropython-lib/tree/master/micropython/umqtt.simple

Fill in the secrets.py values for your WiFi connection and MQTT broker then you're all set

I plan to add the ability to locally toggle the relays but haven't done that bit yet

Might have a tinker with the buzzer next
